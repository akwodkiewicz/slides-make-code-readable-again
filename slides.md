# Why?

---
layout: statement
---


We *read* code more than we *write* it

<!--
Optimize the code for reading, 
it's harder to read code than to write it
-->

---
layout: statement
---

It's easier to work independently on readable code

<!--
As an author make sure that nobody will ever try to contact you about the things you wrote.
Ever. 
-->

---
layout: statement
---

It's easier to review readable code

<!--
Make a brand out of your work.
Do such a good job that your colleagues will not want to review anybody else's code ever again. 
Other people will review your work faster... *click*

layout: statement
---

It's easier to spot bugs

<!--
...and find potential bugs quicker. Maybe you'll even find them yourself before you create a PR.

# Good naming

Named predicates

```ts

# Behaviour goes first

<v-click>

- How does **it** behave, what does **it** do?
- What are the rules of the behaviour, how does **it** do those things?
- What is **it**?

Names convey some meaning.
